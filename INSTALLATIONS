Installation steps:

Upload the project folder to your server using File Manager on CPanel (or any panel you are using). In our case it’s called “laravel-app”

Now go inside the folder and change the permissions of the  application folders, storage and bootstrap/cache to 775 by right clicking on them and choosing “change permissions“

Then go to sub-domains and create a new sub-domain. The document root should points to the public folder of the project. In our case it’s /home/democom/laravel-app/public.

The sub-domain will be as the following:
http://laravel-app.example.com
