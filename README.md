# Core Features of an Online Helpdesk Ticketing System in PHP MySQL
Multi-User Authentication and Role Management
A secure multi-user authentication system is fundamental for a helpdesk ticketing system. It allows different user roles such as agents, administrators, and customers to access the system based on their permissions. Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only perform actions that are within their scope of authority.

User and Admin Dashboards
Dashboards are the main interface through which users interact with the system. The admin dashboard typically includes features for managing users, viewing ticket statistics, and configuring system settings. The user dashboard allows customers to view their ticket history, create new tickets, and track their progress.
Ticket Creation, Management, and Resolution
The core functionality of any helpdesk system is ticket management. Users should be able to create new tickets with detailed descriptions, select categories, and assign priority levels. Agents, in turn, can update ticket statuses, add internal notes, and resolve issues. This feature should include search, filter, and sorting options to allow for quick access to relevant tickets.
Priority Management and SLAs
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define the expected response and resolution times for different types of tickets. By integrating SLAs, you can ensure that high-priority tickets are resolved faster, improving customer satisfaction and compliance with service standards.
Notifications, Alerts, and Escalation Rules
An effective helpdesk system uses notifications and alerts to keep both agents and customers informed about ticket status changes. Escalation rules can be configured to automatically route unresolved tickets to higher-level agents or supervisors after a certain time period.
Knowledge Base and Self-Service Portal
A knowledge base provides customers with self-service options, reducing the number of tickets created. It can include articles, FAQs, and guides to help customers find solutions to common issues. This feature not only improves user experience but also reduces the workload for support teams.
Reporting and Analytics Dashboard
Analytics play a vital role in measuring the efficiency of your support operations. A reporting dashboard should include metrics such as average response and resolution time, number of open and closed tickets, and agent performance. This data helps identify trends and areas for improvement.
Multi-Channel Support Integration
To provide a seamless support experience, the helpdesk system should integrate with various communication channels such as email, live chat, and social media. This ensures that customers can reach out through their preferred channel and all interactions are captured within the  ticketing system.

# Helpdesk Ticketing System Flowchart
The flowchart provides a detailed visual representation of how the helpdesk ticketing system operates from a user’s perspective. The process begins with User Registration/Login, where users (Admins, Agents, or Customers) enter their credentials to gain access to the system. If the user is successfully authenticated, they are directed to their respective dashboards based on their roles: Admin Dashboard, Agent Dashboard, or Customer Dashboard. If authentication fails, an error message is displayed, prompting the user to re-enter their credentials.

Helpdesk Ticketing System Flowchart
Each role has its own set of functionalities within the system. For instance, customers can Create New Tickets by filling out a form that includes the ticket’s title, description, priority level, and category. Once the ticket is created, the system confirms the successful creation of the ticket and redirects the user to view their tickets under the Customer Dashboard.
For agents, the flow starts at the Agent Dashboard, where they can view all assigned tickets, update ticket statuses (e.g., “In Progress” or “Resolved”), and add comments for further clarifications. When agents update the ticket, the customer receives an automatic notification about the ticket’s progress, fostering transparent communication.

Admins have the most control over the system and can manage various aspects, such as users, departments, and categories. They can access Manage Users, Manage Departments & Categories, and View All Tickets functionalities from their dashboard. This allows admins to assign roles, oversee operations, and generate reports to analyze the performance of the support team.

The workflow for ticket resolution is detailed further in the Ticket Workflow sub-section of the flowchart. After a customer creates a ticket, it is Assigned to an Agent based on predefined rules like ticket category and priority. An automatic notification is sent to the agent to alert them of the new assignment. The agent can then Update the Ticket with relevant information or changes, and the customer is notified about these updates in real-time. Once the ticket is resolved, it is marked as “Closed.” If the ticket remains unresolved or if additional support is needed, the system escalates it to a higher-level support team, ensuring that every issue is handled promptly and efficiently.
The ERD consists of six primary entities: Users, Tickets, Categories, Departments, Comments, and Notifications. Each entity has specific attributes and relationships that define how they connect and interact with other entities in the system.

Helpdesk Ticketing System ER Diagram
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Helpdesk Ticketing System Using PHP MySQL represents the database structure and illustrates the relationships between various entities. This design ensures that data flows seamlessly within the system and supports effective data management.
Users: This entity stores information about each user in the system, which includes the attributes user_id, username, email, password, and role. The role attribute specifies whether the user is an Admin, Agent, or Customer. The relationship between Users and Tickets is one-to-many, meaning that a single user can create multiple tickets. Similarly, the relationship between Users and Comments is also one-to-many, indicating that each user can post multiple comments on different tickets.
Tickets: The Tickets entity holds all the information about the tickets created within the system. It includes the attributes ticket_id, user_id (foreign key referencing Users), category_id (foreign key referencing Categories), department_id (foreign key referencing Departments), title, description, priority, status, created_at, and updated_at. Each ticket is linked to a user, a category, and a department, which establishes several one-to-many relationships: a single user can create multiple tickets, each category can have multiple tickets, and each department can handle multiple tickets.
Categories: Categories are used to classify tickets based on the type of issue they represent, such as “Technical Issues” or “Billing Queries.” This entity has attributes like category_id and category_name. The relationship between Categories and Tickets is one-to-many, where each category can have multiple tickets associated with it. This helps in effectively organizing and filtering issues.
Departments: The Departments entity specifies the various departments within the organization, such as “Technical Support” or “Customer Service.” It includes attributes like department_id and department_name. Similar to Categories, the relationship between Departments and Tickets is one-to-many, indicating that each department can manage several tickets. This setup ensures that tickets are routed correctly to the appropriate support team.
Comments: Comments capture all communication logs and internal notes related to a ticket. This entity contains attributes such as comment_id, ticket_id (foreign key referencing Tickets), user_id (foreign key referencing Users), comment_text, and commented_at. This structure establishes a one-to-many relationship between Tickets and Comments, where each ticket can have multiple comments posted by different users. It also forms a one-to-many relationship between Users and Comments, indicating that a single user can post multiple comments on various tickets.
Notifications: Notifications serve the purpose of sending alerts and updates to users about ticket status changes or new comments. The Notifications entity includes attributes like notification_id, user_id (foreign key referencing Users), ticket_id (foreign key referencing Tickets), notification_message, notified_at, and is_read. The relationship between Users and Notifications is one-to-many, as each user can receive multiple notifications. Likewise, each ticket can trigger multiple notifications, establishing a one-to-many relationship between Tickets and Notifications.
